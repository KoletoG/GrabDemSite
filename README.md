This is a famous template for a typical pyramid scheme where there are no winners but you are losing less if you sign in first.
It works with crypto transactions, manually operated and checked. 
Signing in works only with an invite link which you get from other users and of course they win on your back.
There is a 'mining' button which generates you some fake cryptocurrency which you should be able to withdraw.
If you work on teams, there are bonuses for every person you have invited and these bonuses are separated by levels.
The bigger the level you are, the more more money you should be able to make and therefore withdraw.
There is an admin account with a fixed name which you can change in the HomeController.
Deposits and withdraws generate strings of the transaction Id which you should manually check when somebody makes them.
There is a mechanism where you can fake the wallet address to which you can make the deposits.
